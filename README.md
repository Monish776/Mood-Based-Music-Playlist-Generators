📌 Project Overview
The Mood-Based Music Playlist Generator is a Python application that analyzes the emotional tone of a user’s text input (such as journal entries, notes, or tweets) and creates a personalized Spotify playlist that matches the detected mood.

🧠 Objective
Understand the user's emotional state using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Map detected emotions to specific music genres or moods

Automatically generate a playlist using the Spotify API

Help users enhance their emotional well-being through music

🧱 Technology Stack
Python – Core programming language

NLP Libraries:

transformers (Hugging Face) – Emotion classification

TextBlob or VADER – Basic sentiment analysis

APIs:

Spotify Web API – For music search and playlist creation

(Optional) Twitter API – For importing recent tweets

Spotify Library:

spotipy – Python wrapper for Spotify API

(Optional) Streamlit or Flask – For GUI

🧩 Core Features
1. Text Input Handling
Accept text from the user via:

Journal entry (manual input)

Text file upload

Tweets (optional integration)

2. Mood & Sentiment Detection
Analyze emotional tone using a pre-trained model

Detect categories such as:

Joy

Sadness

Anger

Fear

Love

Surprise

3. Mood-to-Genre Mapping
Translate detected emotions into corresponding music genres:

Joy → Pop, Dance

Sadness → Acoustic, Blues

Anger → Metal, Rock

Love → R&B, Romantic

Fear → Ambient, Chill

Surprise → Indie, Electronic

4. Spotify Playlist Creation
Search tracks by genre using Spotify API

Create a new playlist on the user’s Spotify account

Add top tracks matching the emotional mood

🚀 How It Works (Workflow)
User enters a text journal or note

NLP model detects mood: e.g., “joy”

Mood is mapped to genres: e.g., pop, dance

Spotify is queried for matching tracks

A personalized playlist is created and linked

📈 Potential Enhancements
Track and visualize mood trends over time

Let users select from multiple detected moods

Recommend existing Spotify playlists by mood

Add support for YouTube Music or Apple Music

🎓 Learning Outcomes
Use of transformer-based NLP models

Real-world API integration and OAuth

Managing user data flow and response handling

Mapping emotional intelligence to practical applications

(Optional) Building a GUI with Streamlit for better UX# Mood-Based-Music-Playlist-Generators
